    <h2>Decoding My Playlist</h2>

    <p>
        Have you ever wondered what your playlist reveals about you? Let me take you on a journey through the meticulous 
        curation process of my playlist, a collection that reflects not just my taste but the stories and emotions intertwined 
        with each melody.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I curate my playlist?</h3>

    <p>
        My meticulously curated playlist is a reflection of my musical identity. Each addition undergoes a rigorous 4-listen 
        evaluation before earning "liked" status and potential playlist inclusion. I also keep a journal logging all song recommendations 
        from others—treating each suggestion as invaluable inspiration for self-discovery. 
        This deliberate process of immersive listening and thoughtful integration informs a playlist I'm profoundly proud of.
        Here is what is in my playlist....

    <h3>My Playlists</h3>

    <p>For this analysis, I'll focus on nine playlists. Let's begin by determining the number of songs in each playlist.</p>

    <div id="playlist_count"></div>

    <p>"Hodgepodge" stands out as my primary playlist, housing a diverse collection of English music, 
        which explains its higher song count. It's intriguing to discover that playlists I thought I frequently use have relatively few songs. 
        Quality over quantity seems to be the theme. Feel free to click on the bars to navigate to a certain playlist.</p>
    
    <h3>Exploring the Features of my playlist</h3>
    
    <p>
        Spotify has this cool API from which you can get the audio features of your Music. 
        here are some features I gathered:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Acousticness:</strong> Measures acoustic elements' presence.</li>
      <li><strong>Danceability:</strong> Rates the track's dance suitability.</li>
      <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Gauges a track's intensity and activity.</li>
      <li><strong>Speechiness:</strong> Detects spoken words presence.</li>
      <li><strong>Valence:</strong> Rates the positivity of the music.</li>
      <li><strong>Liveness:</strong> Indicates live performance probability.</li>
      <li><strong>Instrumentalness:</strong> Predicts vocal absence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Below is the average audio values of each playlist</p>

    <div id="average_music"></div>

    <p>Exploring the graphs is fascinating. Notably, "Groove" and "Sound of Music" show higher instrumentalness,
         aligning with their roles as study and techno playlists. Despite my love for lyrics, the average speechiness is surprisingly low across.</p>

    <h3>Need Music Recommendations? </h3>
    <p>The artists gracing my playlists are more than just background noise; they're the soundtrack to my life. Each song holds a memory, an emotion, 
        a connection forged through shared experiences. Inspired by this profound influence, I've woven a visual tapestry - a "hall of frame" - where the 
        size of each artist's circle reflects their frequency of appearance in my playlists.</p>
