    <h2>Decoding My Playlist</h2>

    <p>
        Have you ever wondered what your playlist reveals about you? Let me take you on a journey through the meticulous 
        curation process of my playlist, a collection that reflects not just my taste but the stories and emotions intertwined 
        with each melody.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I curate my playlist?</h3>

    <p>
        My meticulously curated playlist is a reflection of my musical identity. Each addition undergoes a rigorous 4-listen 
        evaluation before earning "liked" status and potential playlist inclusion. I also keep a journal logging all song recommendations 
        from others—treating each suggestion as invaluable inspiration for self-discovery. 
        This deliberate process of immersive listening and thoughtful integration informs a playlist I'm profoundly proud of.
        Here is what is in my playlist....

    <h3>My Playlists</h3>

    <p>For this analysis, I'll focus on <span>nine playlists</span>. Let's begin by determining the <span>number of songs in each playlist</span>.</p>

    <div id="playlist_count"></div>

    <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6jbn1cwPrem1cT1guLU5Zl">"Hodgepodge"</a>stands out as my primary playlist, housing a diverse collection of English music, 
        which explains its higher song count. It's intriguing to discover that playlists I thought I frequently use have relatively few songs. 
        Quality over quantity seems to be the theme. Feel free to click on the bars to navigate to a certain playlist.</p>
    
    <h3>Exploring the Features of my playlist</h3>
    
    <p>
        Spotify has this cool <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features">API</a> from which you can get the audio features of your music. 
        Here are some features I gathered:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Acousticness:</strong> Measures acoustic elements' presence.</li>
      <li><strong>Danceability:</strong> Rates the track's dance suitability.</li>
      <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Gauges a track's intensity and activity.</li>
      <li><strong>Speechiness:</strong> Detects spoken words presence.</li>
      <li><strong>Valence:</strong> Rates the positivity of the music.</li>
      <li><strong>Liveness:</strong> Indicates live performance probability.</li>
      <li><strong>Instrumentalness:</strong> Predicts vocal absence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Below is the <span>average audio values of each playlist</span></p>

    <div id="average_music"></div>

    <p>Exploring the graphs is fascinating. Notably, </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/18AIhbwCnKN10i2b3WVcRy">"Groove"</a>and 
       <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6E6I8G7R4eqTlrVlGsgSnr?si=76da9a0f2ede4433">"Sound of Music"</a>show higher instrumentalness,
         aligning with their roles as study and techno playlists. Despite my love for lyrics, the average speechiness is surprisingly low across.</p>

    <h3>Need Music Recommendations? </h3>
    <p>Here are <span>all the songs in my playlist</span>, color coordinated by valence score.
         Lighter colors indicate lower valence (sad songs), while darker colors represent happier tunes.</p>

    <h3>A Musical Tapestry: Exploring the Artists Who Shaped My World</h3>
    <p>The artists gracing my playlists are more than just background noise; they're the soundtrack to my life. Each song holds a memory, an emotion, 
        a connection forged through shared experiences. Inspired by this profound influence, I've woven a <span>visual tapestry - a "hall of frame" </span>- where the 
        size of each artist's circle reflects their frequency of appearance in my playlists.</p>

    <div class="center">
        <button id="toggleButton" onclick="toggleSvgDisplay()">Click for Hall of Fame</button>
    </div>
    <div id="artist-bubble"></div>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Thank you for exploring! I hope you enjoyed the journey through my playlists and found some new tunes.
